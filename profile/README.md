## What is Otio?

It is our project for the Introduction to Mobile Computing (CS310) course in Sabanci University in the term of Spring 2024.
Aside from that, it is an event calendar with a basic account management system where a user can use their personal calendar as kind of an agenda to fill with the places they choose.
(Note: For now, the places are provided at the server-level; a user cannot add a new place on their own.)
